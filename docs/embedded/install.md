# HW and OS

## HW
**TODO: hw, power, case, speaker...**

## OS

For image installation see [installation see ](https://github.com/lawrence-iviani/lisa/blob/main/embedded/image.md)

20201015: this guide is based on a Raspbian 32 bit armhf

## Setup The system

All what matters the raspberry and the basic package installation (pre-requisities and development).

## AUDIO HAT 

Two audio hats are available:

* [MATRIX Voice Standard Version](https://store.matrix.one/products/matrix-voice)
* [ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array for Raspberry Pi](https://respeaker.io/4_mic_array/)

Check the configuration is set right.
In order to making working, into the file [lisa.cfg](https://github.com/lawrence-iviani/rhasspy-lisa-odas-hermes/blob/master/rhasspy_lisa_odas_hermes/config/lisa.cfg) modify accordingly the line with one of the available hats:

odas_config = lisa-odas/config/lisa//lisa_matrix.cfg || lisa-odas/config/lisa/respeaker_4_mic_array.cfg

# SW

Lisa is embodied as a concurrent systems of nodes using MQTT and the Hermes Protocol. A wrapper to interact with ROS systems is available.
An integration a further development of other open sources package, the most important:

* [ODAS](https://github.com/introlab/odas/wiki)
* [RHASSPY](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)

See the installation details in page [lisa node installation]() for making it up and running.

## Configuration

All files can be copied with a script. Both directions are possible, in installation we are interested in copy from the repos to the lisa embedded installation.

```batch
# cd to the root location of the package conatining this file
$ cd path-to-lisa
$ cd scripts
$ python3 copy_util.py --to_lisa 
```

* At 20201025: no alsa conf files are copied. These must be copied manually accordingly to your Audio HAT.
* At 20201025: no configuration of the hat odas.cfg is performed.

# Run the entire solution

* Be sure you have installed Tmuxinator, see See [install tmuxinator](https://github.com/lawrence-iviani/lisa/blob/main/embedded/install.md#tmuxinator)

* Copy the files in [pi/.config](https://github.com/lawrence-iviani/lisa/tree/main/configuration/all/home/pi/config)
This is normally in ~/.config/tmuxinator (please notice as .config is a hidden folder)

* Check the asound.conf is the correct for your HAT and  [lisa.cfg](https://github.com/lawrence-iviani/rhasspy-lisa-odas-hermes/blob/master/rhasspy_lisa_odas_hermes/config/lisa.cfg) is pointing to the right ODAS configuration.

Enjoy, simply use:

```batch
# With LISA_PLATFORM one of the supported boards (Matrix Voice, Respeaker 4 Mic)
# With LISA_LED_PATTERN one of the supported led patterns (GoogleHome, Amazon). These are imitations from [4MICs HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/respeaker/4mics_hat)
$ tmuxinator start lisa_rhasspy_full_start.yml  --hw-board LISA_PLATFORM --led-pattern LISA_LED_PATTERN
```
